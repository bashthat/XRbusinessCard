I found two resources that provide two different ways of testing the development of the website which I believe is the more important side of this project is knowing how to develop use and interact with the website as buttons are created and etc.

So, the second link utilizes google chromes free webserver as an example for developing in.

the other method utliized Vive from the terminal as a basic method to making a local host in the development process for any website.

The above link is a link to a simulator to test AR online. This is one advantage google chrome has over another local-host is AR is utilized with the webserver in the chrome browser with AR support.



I've had fun developing this project, and look forward to developing more with JavaScript and three js.
